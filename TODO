On iOS, dismissing the Import/Export Successful notification triggers another import/export
	- can't replicate in Chrome on desktop
	- caused by combination of window.confirm() & iScroll
Better feedback in import/export
	import - delay after "Imported 57 of 57"
	export - delay after "Sent data to server" (in verifyData()), incorrect count of "exporting 56 of 57"
When moving a series to a different program, need to refresh the progressBar for the new program
Schedule->Episode List, need easy way to get to Series List (to view other series for the same program)
	- maybe use Program name in header as a link, but managing the view stack will be tricky
Ending soon report
  - series with < 2 unwatched/unrecorded episodes
Guide searcher (online, using XMLTV)
Vertically centre list items
Colour coding by person (your shows vs your wifes vs your kids)
		- Add Viewer table ( Name, Colour )
		- On Settings view, add "Viewers" option to "Data" section
		- Add Viewers view (standard CRUD list)
		- Include Viewers in JSON import/export
		- Add ViewerID to Program table
		- Add Viewer row Program view (tap opens an iScroll populated with "Everyone" plus a list of the viewers)
		- Modify Program model to update ViewerID
		- Modify Schedule/Unscheduled/Programs/Reports views to be colour coded
Colour coding by source (Cable vs broadcast vs download)
Prevent horizontal scrolling on phone (remove hack when implemented in iScroll)

Pending standards:
- function.bind(context) to replace $.proxy(function, context)
- ProgressEvent properties in appCache updates (waiting for WebKit update)
- Replace jquery.iphoneui.js with JQuery Mobile when released
